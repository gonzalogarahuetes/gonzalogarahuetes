## Hi, my name is Gonzalo 👋

I am an interdisciplinary professional. Humanities is my main field of study but some years ago I moved into the world of web development.

I have worked as a Full-stack developer, but in my current position I joined Tokeny Solutions as a back-end and devops developer.

My life goes on among books, guitars, films and good people.

Would you like to talk to me, please reach me out at gonzaloarahuetes@proton.me or via LinkedIn.
