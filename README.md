## Hi, I'm Gonzalo ðŸ‘‹

I am an interdisciplinary professional. I have been educated in Humanities but I have moved into the world of web development.

I have worked as a Full-stack developer, but I recently joined Tokeny Solutions as a junior back-end and devops developer.

My life goes on among books, guitars, films and good people.

If you want to talk to me you can reach me out at gonzaloarahuetes@proton.me or by LinkedIn.
